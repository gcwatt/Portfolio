                    <p>The Sanctuary formally came into being as a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the expression of spirituality for people of all beliefs willing to live harmoniously with the earth and all it’s inhabitants in 1969. Inspired by the times and nearby Woodstock Festival, a group of young cousins and their friends donated shares of their family land to the cause. The land has a
                    rich history and deep ties to The Lenni Lenape Tribe as well as to the Pre-Revolution homesteaders that settled The Catskills. There are structures on the property dating back to 1742 and a catalogue of countless Native American artifacts found throughout the years. <br>
                    Presently, The Sanctuary regularly hosts indigenous tribes including; The Lenape, Tieno and Native Guyanese to practice their traditions, ceremonies and beliefs. BDS is also dedicated to educating the community in renewable energies and sustainable agriculture and hosts The Perma Jam Festival annually. Further, The Sanctuary acts as a wildlife refuge and forest preserve to countless native animals, plants and wildflower species. Another cause fostered here at BDS is the care and rescue of horses. Our horses are not only able to thrive here, but
                    provide members and guests much joy while visiting.</p>
