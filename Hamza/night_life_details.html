                    <h3>What's the Line?</h3> <br><br>
                        <p>The forced closure of his bar forces a cash strapped Muy-thai boxer, Mike Guz, to enter the seamy world of New York City afterhours clubs. </p>
  
                    <h3>What's the Story?</h3> <br><br>
                        <p>Based on a true story - straight from Page Six of the New York Post - this is the life of the King of After Hours Clubs. Night/Life is a Drama of a second generation Thai American, Mike Guz, who is forging a new life here. His heritage gives him some advantages in the rough and tumble world of the early aughts club scene - his Kickboxing training for one - but it also comes with the conflict of his conservative family. This is heightened by the inner turmoil he faces when the only way he can make it is by taking his legitimate bar and turning it into an illegal after hours club. With his friend and business partner Charles "Chum" Zelazny they dive into the seamy - yet very lucrative - world of the party that starts after the other parties end. As the varied episodic characters flow through Mike's afterhours club we see him tested in new and varied ways. Rivals jockey for the cash - even attack for it - and his friends start going overboard and become liabilities leaving our protagonist without anyone he can trust. As the lifestyle ripples through his character we see him having to choose between his love for family - and newly forming addictions. Mike starts off as a teetotaler and ends up with what can kindly be described as a poly substance  appreciation. As the pressures of his underworld lifestyle build up he finds himself going way past the type of behaviors he thought he would ever do. </p>

                    <h3>Who are the People?</h3> <br><br>
                        <p>Along for the ride with Mike, characters include; his best friend and business partner "Chum" and his girlfriend the dancer "Shoko". A potential love interest and restaurateur "Liz" as well as "Marie", a reporter with mysterious contacts. We will add in some sprinkles of cameos by DJs, Celebs and the others who actually attended these parties (and Mike knows personally) and start heating up a tasty stew.</p>

                    <h3>What is the World?</h3> <br><br>
                        <p>This story lives in the real nights out adventures Mike and the creator ended up having in New York City - and its varied haunts. From the celebrity studded back rooms of Bungalow 8 to the outlaw parties in the Pine Barrens, many tales are told and in search of the palace of wisdom and the pilgrims that pursue them. What makes this story different is the veracity of the events as linked through many real world locations and people. Limelight in Peter Gatiens day, Bungalow 8 by Amy Sacco and more line the life of Mike Guzman. It's a specific type of party - this isn't a rave (although there was techno) and this isn't a high end nightclub (although there thousands of dollars changing hands) - this is Afterhours. A place you can play a hand of poker or do a nose full of something else. </p>

                    <h3>What Inspires?</h3> <br><br>
                        <p>The series can be seen as a merging between Entourage and The Sopranos. Tonally its like the boys from Entourage were thrust into the underbelly of The Sopranos. We see the lighthearted nature of people making their living through “parties” gradually devolve as they meet the gritty reality of who large cash hauls will bring sniffing like hyenas to a fresh kill. As our main characters continue to make tough choices to survive they keep to their "code".</p>

                    <h3>Raison D' Etre?</h3> <br><br>
                        <p>" It's time for me to expose these events as I knew Mike in those days and attend these events but I befriended him again after running into him at a NYE afterhours. Many glamorize their halcyon days but I tell this not to revel in the debauch of that decade but deliver a compelling story. Everyone from my wife to distant acquaintances love my tales of the real underworld of New York. And this show will give them the fix they are looking for." - Hamza Zaman, Creator</p>
